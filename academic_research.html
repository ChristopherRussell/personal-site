    <p> The primary focus of my thesis was counting isomorphism classes of finite 0-simple semigroups. These semigroups are of interest because they are in some sense the building blocks of all semigroups. These semigroups are are in correspondence with Rees 0-matrix semigroups, the latter of which are constructed from a matrix with entries over a 0-group. Therefore problem of enumerating 0-simple semigroups up to isomorphism can be translated in to a problem of enumerating certain matrices up to an equivalence which corresponds to isomorphism of the semigroups they construct. I have described and implemented counting techniques (in GAP) and applied them to count isomorphism classes of 0-simple semigroups. I also created a database of finite 0-simple semigroups, which required different techniques that are described in my thesis. Furthermore, I determined, and implemented, a combinatorial formula for counting a class of 0-simple semigroups called congruence free semigroups alongside novel combinatorial results. The class of congruence free semigroups are of particular interest as they are in a sense the semigroup analogy of, the much studied, simple groups.</p>
    <p> I am also interested in inverse semigroups, in particular E-unitary
    inverse semigroups and F-inverse semigroups.
