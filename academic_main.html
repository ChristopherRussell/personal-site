    <h1> Academia </h1>
    <p>I was a PhD Student in the School of Mathematics and Statistics
    from September 2016. I submitted my thesis, entitled "Enuemrating 0-simple semigroups",
    in October 2020 and passed my viva subject to minor corrections in January 2021.
    My research is in the area of <i>Computational Semigroup Theory</i> and my supervisor was
    <a href="http://www-groups.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~jamesm/">
        Dr James D. Mitchell
    </a>.
    I also completed my undergraduate degree in St Andrews, graduating with a first
    class MMath degree in 2016. The title of my masters project was
    <i>Constructing a Database of Primitive Permutation Groups</i> 
    and it was supervised by 
    <a href="http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~colva/">
        Dr Colva M Roney-Dougal
    </a>.
    </p>
    <p>I have contributed to the computational algebra system 
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-system/gap">GAP</a> as well as making
    contrubtions to two of its packages: 
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/Semigroups">Semigroups</a> and 
    <a href="https://github.com/gap-packages/Digraphs">Digraphs</a>. As part of my PhD
    Thesis I <a href="https://github.com/ChristopherRussell/0-simple-semigroups">wrote GAP code</a> that can count or generate a database of various classes of 0-simple semigroups.
