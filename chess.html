          <p>This is a chess game I made in basic javascript in order to learn!</p>
          <p>There is some missing functionallity: en-passant, pawn promotion, castling, invlaid
          moves due to check, checkmate.</p>
          <p>It would also be nice if the chessboard did not become taller than screen, I was trying to make it fit the screen rather than be a fixed size. More of an interface would be nice too. However I learned plenty and have moved on.</p>
