      <h2>Teaching</h2>
      On several occasions I lead tutorial groups for modules in the school of mathematics. I loved it, except from the marking, and would have done more if I hadn't taken on other work (see below)!
      <ul>
        <h3>2018</h3>
          <li>Tutored two groups of ten students in the first year module
            MT1002: Mathematics</li>
          <li>Supported lecturer in computer lab teaching (using python) for the module MT2505: Abstract Algebra. This involved helping students with coding and marking their coding projects.</li>
        <h3>2017</h3>
          <li>Tutored two groups of ten students in the first year module MT1003:
            Pure and Applied Mathematics.</li>
        <h3>2016</h3>
          <li>Tutored two groups of ten students in the first year module
            MT1002: Mathematics</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Other</h2>
        For two years during my PhD I worked as an assistant warden in halls of residence, at David Russell Apartments. In this role I was provided pastoral support to students, resolved flat disputes, responded to emergencies at night, and helped foster the community by organising events such as: wine & cheese evenings, board game nights, and a weekly running group.
