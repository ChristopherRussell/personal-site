        <h1> Web Development </h1>
        <p> Since the start of 2021 I have been learning javascript with the aim of creating a simple web game. My inital learning projects are stored here. More recently I have been learning to use the game development framework Phaser. My current project is to create an interactive semigroup visualiser which displays the 'egg box diagram' of a semigroup's Green's classes and allows the user to find out information by interacting with the diagram. This sort of data would noramlly require unweildy by-hand calculations or knowledge of specialised computer algebra software such as the semigroups package of GAP (Groups Algorithms and Programming).
