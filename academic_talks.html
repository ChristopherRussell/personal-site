    <h2>Talks</h2>
      These are some of the talks I gave during my time as a PhD student.
      <ul>
        <h3> 2020 </h3>
            <li> <b>Enumerating binary matrices with all rows and columns distinct up to permutations of rows and columns</b>
                <br>
                <i>School of Mathematics and Statistics Research Day, 23 January 2020.</i>

                </li>
        <h3> 2019 </h3>
            <li> <b>Counting finite congruence free semigroups</b>
                <br>
                Abstract: A congruence free semigroup has only two congruences - the universal congruence and the trivial congruence. A finite semigroup which is congruence free either be a simple group or a 0-simple semigroup with all subgroups trivial. The latter corresponds to binary matrices with all rows unique and all columns unique via the correspondence with Rees 0-matrix semigroups. I will demonstrate a method to count the isomorphism classes of these semigroups, which corresponds with counting these matrices up to permutations of the rows and columns.

        <h3> 2018 </h3>
        <li> <b>Counting congruence free semigroups</b>
            <br>
            Abstract: I will introduce Polya enumeration theory and given some insight into how it can be used together with the inclusion-exclusion principle to tackle the problem of counting the congruence free semigroups up to isomorphism.

            <i>Pure Postgraduate Seminar, 13th November 2018.</i>
         </li>
         <li> <b>Creating a database of 0-simple semigroups</b>
            <br>
            Abstract: 0-simple semigroups are in some sense the building blocks of semigroups. Enumerating these semigroups up to isomorphism boils down to finding certain matrices up to a special equivalence relation. I will explain how I created a database of these for orders < 49, focusing on the strategies that allowed me to compute to higher orders.

        <h3> 2017 </h3>
        <li><b>Inverse Semigroups</b>
        <br>
        Abstract: In this talk I will define inverse semigroups and discuss
        some important tools for their study. I will also show some of the ways
        computational algebra system GAP can be used in research.

        </li>
        <li><b>E-unitary inverse semigroups in GAP</b>
        <br>
        Abstract: The class of E-unitary inverse semigroups is an important
        one in inverse semigroup theory due to McAlisterâ€™s covering theorem
        which states that every inverse semigroup is an idempotent-separating
        homomorphic image of an E-unitary inverse semigroup. The structure of
        these semigroups is more easily understood when they are represented as
        McAlister triple semigroups. I have spent some time implementing these
        objects into the Semigroups package of GAP and I aim to provide an
        overview of what they are, the work I have done and my future plans.

        <h3> 2016 </h3>
        <li><b>Primitive Permutation Groups</b>
        <br>
        Abstract:
        This talk will introduce primitive permutation groups and
        attempt to justify the statement 'primitive permutation groups are the
        building blocks of all permutation groups'.
