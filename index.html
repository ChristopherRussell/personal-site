        <h1> Welcome to my website </h1>
        <p> My name is Christopher Russell and I am a recent Mathematics PhD graduate of the University of St Andrews. This website has some information about my academic life as well as being a space for me to put some hobby projects! The website itself is a hobby project with the aim of learning more web development skills. Consequently, I have avoided using a template in order to learn more but at the cost of how good my website is. </p>
        <p>Outwith mathematics, I have been a keen runner since I started high
        school. During my time at university I competed as a member of the University of St Andrews Cross Country Club, and Fife Athletics Club over distances from 5km to half marathon. I dabble in cycling too. I have been backpacking in Europe during several summers, and my favourite experience was hiking and camping in the Alps. I have been to weddings in China and India. I have been plant-based/vegan for about 2 years in what started out as an experiment to see if it would make me run faster. I love video games, board games, programming, coffee, fantasy novels, and maths problems.
